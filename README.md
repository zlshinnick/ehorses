Open world horse racing game that plays in C++ terminal created with two friends. 

Can be run with: make run_game.

The aim of this game is to level up as a user, level up your horses, and win as many races as possible!

This can be achieved with some key user abilities, such as racing your horses, buying horses, caring for your horses in your stables, breeding horses, leveling up, upgrading, and applying boosts to your horses.

For the racing, the horses are categorized into different tiers, and there are differently ranked races that your horses can be entered into, with varying difficulty and prize XP and cash.

The open world environment includes various locations, including stables, horse market, general store, race track, and the breeding ground.

If one of your horses has a memorable career (5+ wins), they can be entered into the hooves of fame and will be remembered in the game forever!
